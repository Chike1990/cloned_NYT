                    <p class="paragraph">
                        CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young
                        physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment
                        at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations,
                        venturing far beyond the world of known physics.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic
                        particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead
                        he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin
                        with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution
                        could have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted
                        a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the
                        speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the
                        heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged,
                        warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the
                        wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but
                        would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the
                        page and drew a double box around it.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they
                        had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as
                        inflation, looked right.</p>

                        telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the

                        so-called <a

                            title="">gravitational waves</a> — the signature of a universe being wrenched violently
                        apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are
                        the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that
                        Dr. Guth was correct.</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many,
                        including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science
                        comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang
                        itself. It would open vast realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion
                        light-years in space with its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch
                        in a larger cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own
                        universe there might be an endless number of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like
                        a pot of pasta water boiling over.</p>
                    <div>
                        <p class="paragraph"><strong>‘As Big as It Gets’</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p class="paragraph">In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces
                            operating at energies forever beyond the reach of particle accelerators on Earth and yield
                            new insights into gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation
                            of gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of general relativity, should
                            ruffle space-time.</p>
                        <p class="paragraph">Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe
                            expert who was not part of the team, said, “This is huge, as big as it gets.”</p>
                        <p class="paragraph">He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe,
                            sending a telegram encoded in gravitational waves.”</p>
                        <p class="paragraph">The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a
                            bath of microwave radiation that permeates space and preserves a picture of the universe

            <p>Astronomers have found evidence to support the theory of inflation, which explains how
                the
                universe
                expanded so uniformly and so quickly in the instant after the Big Bang 13.8 billion
                years ago.

                        </strong>
                        is just under 14 billion years old. From our position in the Milky Way galaxy, we can
                        observe a
                        sphere that is now about 92 billion light-years across. But there's a mystery. Wherever
                        we look,
                        the
                        universe has an even temperature.

                        </strong>
                        The universe is not old enough for light to have traveled the vast distance from one
                        side of the
                        universe to the other, and there has not been enough time for scattered patches of hot
                        and cold
                        to
                        mix into an even temperature.

                        cup,
                        and from the amount of steam, you can estimate its temperature and how much it has

                        Now turn around and look a mile in the other direction. You see a similar coffee cup, at
                        exactly
                        the
                        same temperature. Coincidence? Maybe. But if you see a similar cup in every direction,
                        you might
                        want to look for another explanation.

                        </strong>
                        There has not been enough time to carry coffee cups from place to place before they get
                        cold.
                        But if
                        all the coffee cups were somehow filled from a single coffee pot, all at the same time,
                        that
                        might
                        explain their even temperature.

                        Bang, the universe expanded faster than the speed of light. Tiny ripples in the

                        expanding
                        energy field eventually grew into the large-scale structures of the universe.

                        been seen and news spread, astrophysicists responded with a mixture of jubilation and
                        caution.</p>

                    <p class="paragraph">Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at M.I.T., wrote in an email, “I think that if
                        this stays true, it will go down as one of the greatest discoveries in the history of
                        science.”</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">John E. Carlstrom of the University of Chicago, Dr. Kovac’s mentor and head
                        of a competing project called the South Pole Telescope, pronounced himself deeply impressed.
                        “I think the results are beautiful and very convincing,” he said.</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">Paul J. Steinhardt of Princeton, author of a competitor to inflation that
                        posits the clash of a pair of universes as the cause of genesis, said that if true, the
                        Bicep result would eliminate his model, but he expressed reservations about inflation.</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">Lawrence M. Krauss of Arizona State and others also emphasized the need for
                        confirmation, noting that the new results exceeded earlier estimates based on temperature
                        maps of the cosmic background by the European Space Agency’s Planck satellite and other
                        assumptions about the universe.</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">“So we will need to wait and see before we jump up and down,” Dr. Krauss
                        said.</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">Corroboration might not be long in coming. The Planck spacecraft will
                        report its own findings this year. At least a dozen other teams are trying similar
                        measurements from balloons, mountaintops and space.</p>
                    <p class="paragraph"><strong>Spirals in the Sky</strong></p>
                    <p class="paragraph">Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out of the cosmic
                        microwaves, which were discovered accidentally by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson at Bell
                        Labs 50 years ago. They won the Nobel Prize.</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets of these waves.
                        He is one of four leaders of Bicep, which has operated a series of increasingly sensitive
                        radio telescopes at the South Pole, where the thin, dry air creates ideal observing
                        conditions. The others are Clement Pryke of the University of Minnesota, Jamie Bock of the
                        California Institute of Technology and Dr. Kuo of Stanford.</p>
                </div>
                <p class="paragraph">“The South Pole is the closest you can get to space and still be on the
                    ground,” Dr. Kovac said. He has been there 23 times, he said, wintering over in 1994. “I’ve been
                    hooked ever since,” he said.</p>

                    <p class="paragraph">In 2002, he was part of a team that discovered that the microwave radiation
                        was polarized, meaning the light waves had a slight preference to vibrate in one direction
                        rather than another.</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">This was a step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the gravitational
                        waves from inflation. Such waves, squeezing space in one direction and stretching it in
                        another as they go by, would twist the direction of polarization of the microwaves,
                        theorists said. As a result, maps of the polarization in the sky should have little arrows
                        going in spirals.</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">Detecting those spirals required measuring infinitesimally small
                        differences in the temperature of the microwaves. The group’s telescope, Bicep2, is
                        basically a giant superconducting thermometer.</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">“We had no expectations what we would see,” Dr. Kovac said.</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">The strength of the signal surprised the researchers, and they spent a year
                        burning up time on a Harvard supercomputer, making sure they had things right and worrying
                        that competitors might beat them to the breakthrough.</p>
                    <p class="paragraph"><strong>A Special Time</strong></p>
                    <p class="paragraph">The data traced the onset of inflation to a time that physicists like Dr.
                        Guth, staying up late in his Palo Alto house 35 years ago, suspected was a special break
                        point in the evolution of the universe.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p class="paragraph">Physicists recognize four forces at work in the world today: gravity,
                        electromagnetism, and strong and weak nuclear forces. But they have long suspected that
                        those are simply different manifestations of a single unified force that ruled the universe
                        in its earliest, hottest moments.</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">As the universe cooled, according to this theory, there was a fall from
                        grace, like some old folk mythology of gods or brothers falling out with each other. The
                        laws of physics evolved, with one force after another splitting away.</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">That was where Dr. Guth came in.</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">Under some circumstances, a glass of water can stay liquid as the
                        temperature falls below 32 degrees, until it is disturbed, at which point it will rapidly
                        freeze, releasing latent heat.</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">Similarly, the universe could “supercool” and stay in a unified state too
                        long. In that case, space itself would become imbued with a mysterious latent energy.</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">Inserted into Einstein’s equations, the latent energy would act as a kind
                        of antigravity, and the universe would blow itself up. Since it was space itself supplying
                        the repulsive force, the more space was created, the harder it pushed apart.</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">What would become our observable universe mushroomed in size at least a
                        trillion trillionfold — from a submicroscopic speck of primordial energy to the size of a
                        grapefruit — in less than a cosmic eye-blink.</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">Almost as quickly, this pulse would subside, relaxing into ordinary
                        particles and radiation. All of normal cosmic history was still ahead, resulting in today’s
                        observable universe, a patch of sky and stars billions of light-years across. “It’s often
                        said that there is no such thing as a free lunch,” Dr. Guth likes to say, “but the universe
                        might be the ultimate free lunch.”</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p class="paragraph">Make that free lunches. Most of the hundred or so models resulting from Dr.
                        Guth’s original vision suggest that inflation, once started, is eternal. Even as our own
                        universe settled down to a comfortable homey expansion, the rest of the cosmos will continue
                        blowing up, spinning off other bubbles endlessly, a concept known as the multiverse.</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">So the future of the cosmos is perhaps bright and fecund, but do not bother
                        asking about going any deeper into the past.</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">We might never know what happened before inflation, at the very beginning,
                        because inflation erases everything that came before it. All the chaos and randomness of the
                        primordial moment are swept away, forever out of our view.</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">“If you trace your cosmic roots,” said Abraham Loeb, a Harvard-Smithsonian
                        astronomer who was not part of the team, “you wind up at inflation.”</p>
